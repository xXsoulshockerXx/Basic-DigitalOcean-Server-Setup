## Setup Apache2 for the Server
After you login we need to setup the server up so it's browseable on the web.

Go to [Setup Apache2 Server Section](tutorials/3-apachesetup.md)

## Create Directories and Set Permissions
Once Apache2 has been configured, now we need to setup the server root directory so you can upload/create/manage web files and view them from the web.

Go to [Create Directories and Set Permissions Section](tutorials/4-dirpermsetup.md)

### Index Files
A generic index file template to test to see if the server is working.

### Script Files
